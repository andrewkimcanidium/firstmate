# Wake handling

`AGENTS.md` section 8 keeps the queue-first drain, the acknowledgement rules, the watcher-kill prohibition, and the no-blind-turn rule inline; this skill owns the rest of the notification-handling procedure.

- Treat any `OPEN DECISIONS` section from the drain as actionable reconciliation input even when no wake record was queued.
- Treat any `UNREAD STATUS` section as newly surfaced status that must be read this turn; those lines are not re-printed after this presentation.
- Treat any `RECORD DIVERGENCE` section as a contradiction between two records of one captain call, never as proof the captain ruled; load `captain-hold-lifecycle` and reconcile it in whichever direction the evidence supports.
- A status line is a wake event, not current state; use `bin/fm-crew-state.sh` when current state matters, especially before re-escalating an old decision, blocker, or pause.
- `bin/fm-classify-lib.sh` owns the distinction between declared `paused:` waits and `blocked:` events needing firstmate action; `bin/fm-brief.sh` owns worker declaration instructions.

Handle actionable wakes as follows:

1. For `signal:`, read the listed event lines first, then reconcile current state only where action depends on it.
2. For `stale:`, inspect the recorded endpoint and load `stuck-crewmate-recovery` for a stopped, looping, confused, or unresponsive worker; a deep-inspection reason also requires current-state and validation-log inspection.
3. For `check:`, act on the named poll result, including merges, contribution signals, Relay events, process-to-event source results, and captain inbox notes; a handled inbox note is also acknowledged with `bin/fm-inbox.sh drain --ack <id>`, or it stays counted as still waiting for firstmate.
   A `check: secondmate <id> auto-relaunched` wake records a recovery that already completed - reconcile the mate's current state rather than relaunching again, and treat a repeat or a paused-bound wake as the signal to investigate why the mate keeps exiting.
   When the note needs a durable answer the submitter can read, publish it with `bin/fm-inbox.sh reply <id>` (the script header owns the reply contract) rather than leaving the answer only in this transcript.
4. For `heartbeat:`, review the whole fleet from the structured fleet view, reconcile suspicious tasks and PR state, update the backlog, and never report an unchanged fleet as progress.

When any wake reports a merged PR for a project cloned in this home, refresh that clone through the guarded fleet-sync path.
When Relay-linked work reaches a milestone or terminal state, load `fmx-respond`; before terminal teardown, use its promised-final reconciliation when a typed public commitment exists, otherwise post the final completion follow-up so the link clears even if earlier follow-ups were spent.

A secondmate's idle endpoint is healthy, and parent supervision relies on its routed status rather than treating a quiet pane as stale.
Waiting on a healthy supervision cycle is silent; empty polls, elapsed time, and no-change updates are not captain-facing progress.
A forced repair must use the home-scoped owner path emitted by supervision instructions.

Guard warnings do not replace the contract.
Queued wakes must be presented before other action and acknowledged only after handling, stale liveness must be repaired through the emitted protocol, and the worktree-tangle warning must be resolved without touching unlanded work.
The spawn assertion and generated ship brief must both enforce that project work starts in an isolated disposable worktree, never the primary checkout.
Harness-aware turn-end guards are structural backstops, not permission to omit the live cycle.
